#### LEGACY assignments for Relay 1, 5 and 6 and Dig In 4
#### WILL CONFLICT with second channel on WaveShare dual channel CANbus hats, and possiblly others
####	interrupts, chip selects and second SPI bus
#### single channel CANbus hats should be OK with these assignments
####	this includes using only the first channel of the WaveShare dual channel hats
#### note that WaveShare sells two different dual channel CANbus hats: the non FD and FD (flexible data rate)

# This is a list of GPIO pins, set by the script /etc/rcS.d/S90gpio_pins.sh
# They are documented at: https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/bbb-gpio
# Format: <pin_number> <direction: in/out> <name>
#
# The <name> part is used to create an symlink in /dev/gpio.

# relays are active HIGH
# Relay 1   GPIO 21 / header pin 40
21  out relay_1
# Relay 2   GPIO 17 / header pin 11
17  out relay_2

# Relay 3   GPIO 27 / header pin 13
27  out relay_3
# Relay 4   GPIO 22 / header pin 15
22  out relay_4
# Relay 5   GPIO 23 / header pin 16
23  out relay_5
# Relay 6   GPIO 24 / header pin 18
24  out relay_6

# these have pull UPs
# Digital input 1   GPIO 5 / header pin 29
5   in digital_input_1
# Digital input 2   PIO 6 / header pin 31
6   in digital_input_2

# in stock code these have pull DOWNs
#### modified to pull UPs by the GPIO overlay that is installed as part of this package

# Digital input 3   GPIO 13 / header pin 33
13  in digital_input_3
# Digital input 4   GPIO 19 / header pin 35
19  in digital_input_4
# Digital input 5   GPIO 26 / header pin 37
26  in digital_input_5

#### Gracefull shutdown input
#### Note this input is NOT added to the available I/O used by Venus OS !!!!
# GPIO 16 / header pin 36
16  in digital_input_6
