#### modified for use by the RpiGpio package on Raspberry PI platforms ONLY

# This is a list of gpio pins, set by the script /etc/rcS.d/S90gpio_pins.sh
# They are documented at: https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/bbb-gpio
# Format: <pin_number> <direction: in/out> <name>
#
# The <name> part is used to create an symlink in /dev/gpio.

# relays are active HIGH
# Relay 1   Pin 40 / GPIO 21
21  out relay_1
# Relay 2 Pin 11 / GPIO 17
17  out relay_2

# Relay 3 Pin 13 / GPIO 27
27  out relay_3
# Relay 4 Pin 15 / GPIO 22
22  out relay_4
# Relay 5 Pin 16 / GPIO 23
23  out relay_5
# Relay 6 Pin 18 / GPIO 24
24  out relay_6

# these have pull UPs
# Digital input 1   Pin 29 / GPIO 05
5   in digital_input_1
# Digital input 2   Pin 31 / GPIO 06
6   in digital_input_2


# in stock code these have pull DOWNs
#### modified to pull UPs by the GPIO overlay that is installed as part of this package

# Digital input 3   Pin 33 / GPIO 13
13  in digital_input_3
# Digital input 4   Pin 35 / GPIO 19
19  in digital_input_4
# Digital input 5   Pin 37 / GPIO 26
26  in digital_input_5

#### Gracefull shutdown input
#### Note this input is NOT added to the available I/O used by Venus OS !!!!
# Pin 36 / GPIO 16
16  in digital_input_6
