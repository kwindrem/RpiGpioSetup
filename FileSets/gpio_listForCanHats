#### ALTERNATE assignments for Relay 1, 5 and 6 and Dig In 4
#### avoids conflict with second CANbus hat interface
####	supports Waveshare dual CAN and dual CAN FD
####		should work with CAN FD mode A or mode B
####		 but not more than 1 CAN FD hat board
####	NO i2c bus is possible since relay 1 and dig in 4 use these pins !!!!
####	must use spi1-1cs.dtbo overlay, NOT spi1-3cs.dtbo because of conflicts
####		digital input 3 conflicts with spi0-1 interrupt on CAN FD hat
####		Shutdown monitor shutdown GPIO spi1-2 chip select on CAN FD hat
####		relay 2 conflicts wih spi1-1 chip select on CAN FD hat
####		relay 4 conflicts wih spi1-2 interrupt on CAN FD hat
#
#### other conflicts must be resolved manually by carefully selecting hat boards
####	and creating a custom gpio_list file

#### for use by the RpiGpio package on Raspberry PI platforms ONLY

# This is a list of GPIO pins, set by the script /etc/rcS.d/S90gpio_pins.sh
# They are documented at: https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/bbb-gpio
# Format: <pin_number> <direction: in/out> <name>

# The <name> part is used to create an symlink in /dev/gpio.

# relays are active HIGH
# Relay 1   GPIO 2 / header pin 3 ALTERNATE assignment
2  out relay_1
# Relay 2   GPIO 17 / header pin 11
17  out relay_2

# Relay 3   GPIO 27 / header pin 13
27  out relay_3
# Relay 4   GPIO 22 / header pin 15
22  out relay_4
# Relay 5   GPIO 12 / header pin 32 ALTERNATE assignment
12  out relay_5
# Relay 6   GPIO 4 / header pin 7 ALTERNATE assignment
4  out relay_6

# these have pull UPs
# Digital input 1   GPIO 5 / header pin 29
5   in digital_input_1
# Digital input 2   GPIO 6 / header pin 31
6   in digital_input_2

# in stock code these have pull DOWNs
#### modified to pull UPs by the GPIO overlay that is installed as part of this package

# Digital input 3   GPIO 13 / header pin 33
13  in digital_input_3
# Digital input 4   GPIO 3 / header pin 5 ALTERNATE assignment
3  in digital_input_4
# Digital input 5   GPIO 26 / header pin 37
26  in digital_input_5

#### Gracefull shutdown input
#### Note this input is NOT added to the available I/O used by Venus OS !!!!
# GPIO 16 / header pin 36
16  in digital_input_6
