This package adds additional digital inputs and relay outputs

The stock RPI Venus distribution includes two relays and two digital inputs

This script adds:
    the additional GPIO pins (5 total) to /etc/venus/gpio_list
    makes additional digital inputs available
    makes all digital inputs behave the same: pull up so they are active low
    shutdown command to Device List / Settings / General

To use the shutdown command, pins 38 and 36 of the RPI's GPIO header must be connected
    If you don't want the shutdown command to function, do not jumper these pins

The Raspberry PI default is for the first 8 GPIO pins to have pull UPs
and the remaining have pull DOWNs. This makes some digital input pins behave differently
This script installs a DT overlay that switches to pull UPs for all digital input pins

This package adds 4 more relays.

Only the first relay can be assigned to a function: alarm, genertor start/stop or pump.
Others are only provided manual on/off control from the menu.

The remaining 5 relays are manual on/off only.

This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

Setup:

The easiest way to install this or other of my packages is to first install SetupHelper,
then use its package install tool. Refer to the SetupHelper ReadMe for instructions.

There are two other methods to fetch a package archive.

IF the Venus device has internet access is to run the following command:

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/RpiGpioSetup/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data

If the Venus device does not have internet access, you will need to fetch the archive using a computer that does have internet access:

click on this link in a web browser:
https://github.com/kwindrem/RpiGpioSetup/archive/current.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.
When Venus boots, it will unarchive the file to /data/RpiGpioSetup-current

Move the directory into it's active locaiton:
rm -rf /data/RpiGpioSetup
mv /data/RpiGpioSetup-current /data/RpiGpioSetup

Repeat the above for SetupHelper if you haven't done so for another package.

Finally, run the setup script to complete the installation
/data/RpiGpioSetup/setup

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
