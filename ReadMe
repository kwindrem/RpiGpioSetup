This package adds additional digital inputs and relay outputs

The stock RPI Venus distribution includes two relays and two digital inputs

This script adds:
    the additional GPIO pins (5 total) to /etc/venus/gpio_list
    makes additional digital inputs available
    makes all digital inputs behave the same: pull up so they are active low

The Raspberry PI default is for the first 8 GPIO pins to have pull UPs
and the remaining have pull DOWNs. This makes some digital input pins behave differently
This script installs a DT overlay that switches to pull UPs for all digital input pins

This package adds 4 more relays.

Only the first relay can be assigned to a function: alarm, genertor start/stop or pump.
Others are only provided manual on/off control from the menu.

The remaining 5 relays are manual on/off only.

This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

Setup:

The easiest way to install this or other of my packages is to first install SetupHelper
which you need to do anyway,
then use its package install tool. Refer to the SetupHelper ReadMe for instructions.
