compile:
  dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o VenusGpioOverlay.dtbo VenusGpioOverlay.dts
  dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o VenusGpioOverlayForCanHats.dtbo VenusGpioOverlayForCanHats.dts

Put it in /u-boot/overlays:
    sudo cp VenusGpioOverlay.dtbo /u-boot/overlays/VenusGpioOverlay.dtbo

Add a line to /u-boot/config.txt:
    dtoverlay=VenusGpioOverlay

The alternat overlay: VenusGpioOverlayForCanHats.dtbo is a companion for the alternate gpio_list. Install whichever is appropriate


You will need to compile host that has dtc installed such as Raspberry PI OS. Most desktop computers do not have dtc and you probalby can't install it there. Venus OS also does NOT have dtc installed.

Note /u-boot typically appears as /boot when the SD card is mounted on a computer
